        <p style="color: white;">Virat Kohli senior career began when he made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji One-Day Trophy, but he did not have the opportunity to bat during the match.[1] On the international stage, he has been representing India since he was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka. With his national side, he won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup alongside several Asia Cups. He had previously led his side to the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup title. In league cricket, Kohli has played for the Royal Challengers Bengaluru since the inception of the team in 2008.
            <br><br>In August 2008, Kohli was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt.[29] So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[30] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series.[31] On August 18, 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[32] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli scored his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[33]<br><br>In the first seven matches of the Commonwealth Bank triangular series that India played against hosts Australia and Sri Lanka, Kohli made two fifties–77 at Perth and 66 at Brisbane, both against Sri Lanka.[33] Being set a target of 321 by Sri Lanka, Kohli came to the crease with India's score at 86/2 and went on to score 133 not out from 86 balls to take India to a comfortable win with 13 overs to spare.[92] India earned a bonus point with the win and Kohli was named Man of the Match for his knock.[93] Former Australian cricketer and commentator Dean Jones rated Kohli's innings as "one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time".[94] However, Sri Lanka beat Australia three days later in their last group fixture and knocked India out of the series.[95] With 373 runs at 53.28, Kohli finished as India's highest run-scorer and lone centurion of the series.
